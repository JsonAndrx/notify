# Compiled binaries for the current project, if built outside of the current directory
# For example, if you use `go install` to install your binary to GOBIN
# or a custom build directory.
# If your main package is in the root, you might add:
# project_name
# If your main package is in a subdirectory, you might add:
# bin/
# build/

# Go module cache
# This ignores the module cache that Go creates for dependencies.
# This can be large and is not needed in the repository.
# The `go.mod` and `go.sum` files are essential and should NOT be ignored.
